# Diagnostic Lab App - Flutter + Firebase (Starter)

This is a starter scaffold for a Diagnostic Lab mobile app using Flutter and Firebase.
It contains key files: `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/` with main code, services, and screens.

IMPORTANT: To run:
1. Install Flutter and create a new Flutter project: `flutter create diagnostic_lab_app`
2. Replace the generated project's `pubspec.yaml` and `lib/` folder with the contents from this zip.
3. Add Firebase Android/iOS config files (`google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist`) to the project.
4. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (see `.env.example`).
5. Run `flutter pub get` then `flutter run`.

This starter is provided as-is. You will need to enable Firebase Phone Auth, Firestore, and Storage for full functionality.
